1. Fully_Connected_Neural_Network: Added in missing forward and backward code to finish the fully connected linear network. Used the network to classify the Iris dataset. Added a second "Pima Indians Diabetes" dataset.

2. MLP_FashionMNIST_CNN_CIFAR10.ipynb: Wrote two Neural Nets in Pytorch. The first is a 4-level fully-connected network for the FashionMNIST dataset. Final accuracy is 81%. The second is a network with 6 CNN layers followed by 3 fully-connected linear layers. Final accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset is 82%.
